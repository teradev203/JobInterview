2. What is my strength and weakness?

- strength

My strength is creativity and tenacity. Being able to gather clients’ requirements and translate those into an engaging, effective, and unique website is what has helped me obtain positive reviews.
I love failure, learning from failure, and how to deal with failure next time.
Thus being optimistic, and never give up to realize my dream.
--------------------------
My biggest passion is learning about software and technology. I was fascinated with computers from a young age, so I decided to study Computer Science in college and I’ve continued in that direction since graduating. It’s been a great choice for me! As a full-stack software developer, I get to shape how the internet is progressing and how websites are evolving, and that’s exciting to me.

- weakness

I always try to avoid confrontation, in both my personal and professional life. This caused me to compromise sometimes on the quality of my work or what I needed to complete a project just to keep the peace. This became a real problem when I became a manager. One of the most critical aspects of managing people is telling them what they need to hear and not what they want to hear. I recognized this weakness and had been actively working to voice my opinions constructively and helpfully for the improvement of the team.

Understanding and diving into the Crypto world was my dream.

But this company is really valuable to work for me and great fit in my interest.
So I am really focusing on the interview with this company.

6. Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

In five years, I would like to become an engineering lead or team manager. As a web developer with your business, I know I would be able to take on a number of wide-ranging responsibilities related to the company’s web efforts. This would help me refine my knowledge of all areas of the company’s stack, which could then be applied in a managerial role further down the line.

I don’t have anything else to add. I feel like we covered the important topics, and I was able to share the key pieces of my background.

----------------------
-Least

The company was growing quickly, so it was a bit disorganized and I often had multiple supervisors and senior team members giving me different instructions. However, I think this was a great opportunity to improve my ability to work under pressure and my communication skills. For example, I had to learn to communicate clearly and quickly to clarify with my managers and team if there was a conflict in what I had been asked to do. I enjoyed most aspects of the job and I ended up liking working in such a fast-paced environment in the end. It just took some adjustment. It was a great learning experience for me.

-Most

I love how the company offered learning opportunities and seemed to care about helping their employees develop and grow professionally. They had weekly lunch meetings where we’d learn a new topic, they offered tuition reimbursement, and all of the senior leadership team was very approachable and supportive.
