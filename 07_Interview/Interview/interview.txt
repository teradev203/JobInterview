1.introduce myself.

My name is Wei Chen from Hong Kong.
Ever since I was little, I wanted to be the best programmer.
That time, my mother had oppose insistently my determination.
But, I had became finally a programmer with my father help.
So, I went to Hong Kong University of Science and Technology to learn coding for 4 years.
I got my bachelor's degree from this university.
==================================================== == ==============
Firstly, after graduating from university, I got a job at Vensafe Technology Limited in Hong Kong based on 4 years of experience and skills.
Here, as a full stack developer, I have been involved in building many projects using the MERN stack.
I worked for this company for 1 year.

After working here for a year, I got a job as a Frontend developer for a Consultant company in Aresto's.
I used MEAN stack mainly for this company to build CMS and other projects.
So far, I've been working mostly alone as a full-stack developer.
When I was developing the KaanaShop project recently, I really felt rewarded and learned a lot while working with my teammates.
For example joined building shopping sites like KaanaShopping with MEAN stack.
The team have gived the task to strong entire project 's secure specially and newly and to make responsive frontend .
For me, The frontend wasn't problem, but The secure problem was a challenge.
So about the administrator authentication,  I thought I am going to solve the login with Duopush and temporary password.
For a few days, I have researched about it and implemented it.
It's fast and easy to log in securely with Duo Push, the more secure method of two-factor authentication supported by Duo Mobile. 
After logging in with username and password, users can choose Duo Push on the authentication prompt. 
Then, they can simply tap 'Approve' on the push notification they'll receive on their phone seconds later to securely access their application.
I have solved the API about this process using Node.js and Express.js
As a result, project 's secure is  more stronger than before.


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
My skills are
as a frontend Angular.js React.js React-Redux, Vue, Next, Responsive Web Design.
as a backend Node, PHP, Express, Laravel.
as a database mysql, mongodb.
My top skill is MERN stack and MEAN stack.
I am confident that I have the skills and experience that would make me the perfect candidate for this position. 
I would be grateful for the opportunity to discuss this further with you in an interview. 
Thank you for your time and consideration.

Instead of pointing fingers, my first reaction was to take a step back
